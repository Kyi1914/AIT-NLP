## Overview of this assignment

### Brief Introduction
In this assignment, I will  build an instruction model using the Large Language Model (LLM)
from Hugging Face.

## Task 1:  Alpaca Dataset
I use the alpaca dataset and build an instructin format.

## Task 2: Model Training
In this task, I incorporate the Alpaca dataset and train a language model. The training process involves utilizing the Trainer and SFT (Self-feeding Transformer) methods to optimize the model's understanding of context and style in textual data.

## Task 3: Model Evaluation
In this task, I evaluate the performance of the language model using the Alpaca evaluation dataset. The evaluation process involves comparing the generated text from my model with the gold labels provided in the dataset. By assessing how well the model's generated output aligns with the expected outputs, I can measure its effectiveness in understanding context and style and producing coherent text.

## Task 4: Text Generation - Web Application Development 
For this task, I create a simple web application that showcases the capabilities of our language model. The web application includes an input box where users can enter a text prompt. Upon submitting the prompt, the model generates a continuation of the text based on the input. Users can then view the generated text directly on the web page. The application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the language model and demonstrates its real-world application in generating coherent text based on user input.
